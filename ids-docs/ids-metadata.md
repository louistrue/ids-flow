# Guide to effective IDS metadata

IDS is designed to be readable by both humans and computers. Just as it is important to precisely and accurately describe **Specifications** to computers, it is equally important to describe the purpose, intentions, and utility of the **Specifications** to recipients of the IDS. This is achieved by filling out **Specification** metadata. When model authors, designers, engineers, clients, consultants, and other stakeholders clearly understand why information is needed, who it benefits, and when it will be used, it will help guarantee that requirements are met effectively.

## IDS metadata

Each `.ids` file has basic metadata that are common to all **Specifications** listed inside the IDS.
